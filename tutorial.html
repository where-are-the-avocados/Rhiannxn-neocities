  <h1>Windows 98 VirtualBox Installation Guide</h1>

  <p>In this tutorial I will teach you how to properly install Windows 98 SE on a Virtual Machine, so you can use
    vintage software and play retro videogames with no problem.
    I decided to create this since there are a few tutorials on the internet but I feel like they're confusing or
    incomplete, since most of them don't teach you how to install
    the video and audio drivers. I'll promise to keep it as simple as I can!</p>

  <h3>You need these things first</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A PC</li>
    <li>Internet connection</li>
    <li>Windows 98 ISO</li>
    <li>Windows 98 drivers</li>
    <details>
      <summary>Optional</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Videogames</li>
        <li>Useful links</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
  </ul>
  <div class="main">
    First of all you need to install VirtualBox on your PC, mine one has Intel but I've heard AMD has some problems with
    virtualization.
