            <h2>Thoughts on my friendships</h2>
            <p>I've been thinking about my friendships, specially those friends I've made via discord.<br>
                I think they do not appreciate me, they usually ignore me or mock about my personal problems.
                They made another group where they talk but they made a "new sub-group" of friends and I'm no longer
                part of it. The elitism has dominated their attitudes and they make me feel bad and like I'm wrong in
                what I'm doing. <br>
                They make me feel aparted. Now I'm not sure if they even like me, I don't usually connect to their voice
                chats because of that.</p>
