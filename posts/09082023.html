            <h2>Bullying</h2>
            <p>I've been thinking about a period of time when my classmates tend to insult me needlessly, this was
                like
                2015-2019. I remember being insulted with homophobic and transphobic slurs, they liked to interrupt me
                when I
                talked calling me "dumb ass bitch". This ended abruptly in february 2019 when I got drunk at a party and
                an
                ex-classmate sexually asault me; Nowadays I can't help thinking about sex without disgust. I don't
                remember if I
                ever told anyone about this, but this highly impacted on my relationships. <br>
                This awful moment of my life impacted on my life also on my decisions, I picked a career that I hate
                because of
                self hate, at University I couldn't improve, I didn't got any friends and I was
                a mediocre student, this caused me problems to find professional practice and a stable job. <br>
                My parents were part of this, they were dealing with a divorce through that period of time, my father
                was in a burnout
                and it directly impacted on his marriage, thus in his children. They used to attack me pointleslly,
                about everything, my mom used to tell me that she didn't like me, that I was a loser, make fun of my
                face. Also she got drunk and insulted me several times.</p>
