            <h2>Threatened</h2>
            <p>A "friend" of mine threatened me today because I said I didn't like her friend who made fun of the way I
                talk and the career I studied. Since I know her she has been rude to me. She
                said a couple of times
                how my friends are better than me because of the careers we chose, how many times we ever been in a
                relationship, our
                look, and a big etcetera. I couldn't chose my career because I didn't get enough score at the admission
                test. It has always been something that hurts me and she knows it, and then she makes fun of it.
                "Loser".

                So, immediatly after I said I don't like her. He told me I was an hypocrite, liar, awful human being and
                also I should be more careful with what I say
                because
                I could get hurt eventually. It's been many hours and the truth is I feel scared and vulnerable, I have
                no
                one
                to talk to about this either. <br>
                It was really awkward how he swinged between emotions and feelings, it was a blazing rage towards me.
                The way he treated me was just too intense, and no one defended me. I don't know, maybe he has some
                borderline
                personality disorder? <br><br>
                <b>Update: </b>Some days later we had a meeting and he was really agressive to me, also his friend. They
                are
                gonna
                crucify me.
