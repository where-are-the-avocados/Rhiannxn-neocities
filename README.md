# Rhiannxn-neocities

## Repo's Objetive

This repository's purpose is to maintain and keep a backup of my neocities website.

## Website's Objetive

Its purpose is to improve my coding skills in HTML/CSS, JS and web design.

## Information

Everything (or almost) was made by hand, trial and error! Because I've been learning by self-taught. So every advice or tip will be gratefully accepted on comments
or messages! I accept tips, critics and recommendations; especially on the aircraft site, since I haven't figure out how to improve its loading time.
