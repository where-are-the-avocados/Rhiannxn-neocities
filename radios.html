      <h2>Electronics</h2>
      Radios and turntables must be my main hiperfixations, I collect them since I was fourteen years old. I haven't
      posted yet about this since I have a few traumas talking about this.
      <section>
        My goal is to make all of them 100% functional, but I don't have time nor technical knowledge about electronics,
        in the meanwhile I'm investigating.

        <h3>What are radios?</h3>
        Well radios are sound communication systems who transmite via radio waves. If you were born after 1920 you
        probably know what are them.

        <h3>What are turntables?</h3>
        It is a device to play music through vinyls or acetate disks. Vinyls can come in different formats and sizes,
        being the most common ones 7" 45 RPM and 12" 33 1/3 RPM, but it is also
        possible to find 10" 78 RPM and 16 RPM were made on 7" and 12", but they are incredibly hard to find.
