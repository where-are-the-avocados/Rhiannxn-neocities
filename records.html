        <h1>Records!</h1>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>One my favorite hobbies besides listening to the radio, is it to collect old records on different places and
            digitalize them
            to preserve their history. No one has documented most of records made and published in Chile so my goal is
            to
            preserve some
            of this history. I have neved uploaded this. This website will be full of this information as I have time to
            add
            it.
        </p>
        <h2>What are them?</h2>
        <p>I have a bunch on records that I inherited years ago and I've been buying from a while. Most of them are 7"
            45
            RPM records that are commonly sold just for $1 dollar.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite records are made in Chile because they are high-quality and pretty cheap compared to US and
            European
            editions. The main differences are that some titles are translated to spanish and de label is not made of
            cardboard, they are made
            on a photograph over a plastic label. Weird, but it works pretty well.</p>
